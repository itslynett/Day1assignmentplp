1. What is Software Engineering and Why is it Important?
Software engineering is the process of creating, testing, and maintaining software. It helps make sure that software works well, is easy to use, and solves real problems. It is important because technology is used everywhere today, from banking to healthcare, and good software makes things run smoothly.

2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering:
1950s-1960s: The first programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were created.
1970s-1980s: New methods like the Waterfall model helped organize software development.
1990s-Present: Agile development and cloud computing made software creation faster and more flexible.
3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Planning: Decide what the software should do.
Analysis: Study the needs of users and the system.
Design: Create a plan for how the software will work.
Implementation (Coding): Write the software program.
Testing: Check for mistakes and fix them.
Deployment: Release the software for people to use.
Maintenance: Keep improving the software over time.
4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies:
Waterfall: A step-by-step method where each phase is finished before moving to the next. Example: Used in making medical software where mistakes must be avoided.
Agile: A flexible method where small parts of the software are updated often. Example: Used in making mobile apps that need frequent updates.
5. Roles in a Software Engineering Team:
Software Developer: Writes and fixes code to build software.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the software to find and report errors.
Project Manager: Plans the work, sets deadlines, and makes sure the team works well together.
6. Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development:
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Help developers write and test code easily. Examples: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm.
VCS (Version Control Systems): Keep track of changes in code and help teams work together. Examples: Git, GitHub.
7. Common Challenges for Software Engineers and How to Overcome Them:
Finding and fixing errors: Use debugging tools and write clean code.
Meeting deadlines: Plan well and manage time wisely.
Keeping up with new technology: Keep learning and practicing new skills.
8. Types of Software Testing:
Unit Testing: Checking small parts of the code (like a single function).
Integration Testing: Making sure different parts of the software work together.
System Testing: Testing the whole software program.
Acceptance Testing: Ensuring the software meets user needs before it is released.
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1. What is Prompt Engineering and Why is it Important?
Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear and specific instructions (prompts) for AI to get better answers. It helps improve the quality and usefulness of AI-generated responses.

2. Example of Improving a Prompt:
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the differences between electric and gas-powered cars, including cost, speed, and impact on the environment."
